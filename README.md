# Emacs VSCode Default High Contrast

This theme is my attempt to replicate the Default High Contrast theme on VSCode.

It is a part of my slow migration over to Emacs from VSCode.

Currently basic font locks are set, as well as cursor, line highlight, search highlight, a bit of neotree,
a basic tweaking of modeline, js2mode, and htmlmode.

This will slowly be worked on over time. If you somehow come across this and want to contribute, I would be happy to pull your changes in!
